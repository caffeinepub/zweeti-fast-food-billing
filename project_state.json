  "summary": "Zweeti Fast Food Billing app — a mobile-friendly fast food billing web app. The user has provided an updated CSS reference design with: gradient body background (linear-gradient 135deg #ff5722 to #ff9800), app container max-width 420px with #f5f5f5 background, orange #ff5722 header bar, white cards with border-radius 12px and box-shadow, table headers with #ffe0d6 background, buttons full-width with border-radius 8px (Print: #4caf50, PDF: #2196f3, Clear: #9e9e9e). User has also requested Invoice Number and Date fields. Save as PDF button calls window.print(). GST toggle checkbox (checked by default) toggles GST (5%) on/off. A login screen has been updated to use Firebase OTP phone authentication: phone input (+91XXXXXXXXXX), a recaptcha div, a Send OTP button, an OTP input, and a Verify button. Firebase Authentication integration is being added using Firebase JS SDK v9.23.0.",
