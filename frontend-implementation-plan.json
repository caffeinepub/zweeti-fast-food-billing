Import the html2pdf library at the top of the file. Update the handleDownload function to: (1) select the bill content area containing customer name, items table, subtotal, GST, and grand total using a ref or querySelector, (2) configure html2pdf with appropriate options (filename: 'zweeti-bill.pdf', margins, format), (3) call html2pdf to capture the content and trigger download. Ensure the 'Download Bill' button retains the existing hidden-on-print class so it remains hidden during print. Remove any code that generates or downloads .txt files."
