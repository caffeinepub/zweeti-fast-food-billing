        "If the mobile number is invalid (not 10 digits), the billing screen remains hidden and an error message is shown.",
        "The billing screen container corresponds to the section that houses BillingForm, BillSummary, invoice details, daily/date-wise sales reports, and action buttons.",
        "The transition between login screen and billing screen is controlled by React state (not direct DOM style manipulation), consistent with the existing implementation pattern in App.tsx."

          "description": "Review the existing login gate state logic and ensure that the billing screen container (the main section containing BillingForm, BillSummary, daily totals, and sales reports) is conditionally rendered based on the login state. The billing UI must be hidden (not rendered or display:none via className) when isLoggedIn is false, and fully visible when isLoggedIn is true after successful 10-digit mobile number validation. Ensure no direct DOM manipulation is used; rely entirely on React state and conditional rendering or CSS classes controlled by state."
