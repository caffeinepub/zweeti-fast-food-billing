  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-8 by replacing the plain-text download logic with html2pdf.js PDF generation in App.tsx. The implementation uses a CDN-loaded html2pdf.js script, builds a self-contained HTML element capturing customer name, items table, subtotal, GST, and grand total, and downloads it as 'zweeti-bill.pdf'. The button is hidden during print via existing CSS print media rules. All acceptance criteria appear to be met.",
