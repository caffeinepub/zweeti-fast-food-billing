  "summary": "The diff only shows a modification to project_state.json (a metadata/tracking file), with no changes to App.tsx or any source code file. REQ-52 requires pre-populating the phone number input with '+911234567890' and the OTP input with '123456' via React state initializers in App.tsx. No such changes are present in the diff.",
