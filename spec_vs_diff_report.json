  "summary": "The diff modifies frontend/src/firebase.ts to implement a stub Firebase Auth API that explicitly permits localhost and 127.0.0.1 as authorized domains, mirroring the real Firebase Auth API surface (auth, RecaptchaVerifier, signInWithPhoneNumber, ConfirmationResult). The implementation is largely aligned with REQ-50, though the preservation of real Firebase credentials is unclear.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-50",
      "requirement": "The real Firebase credentials already stored in firebase.ts remain unchanged.",
      "reason": "The diff shows firebase.ts is a pure stub implementation with no real Firebase credentials present. The constraint states 'Do not change or remove the real Firebase credentials already stored in frontend/src/firebase.ts' and the AC states 'The real Firebase credentials already stored in firebase.ts remain unchanged.' The file summary confirms it is a 'Firebase Auth stub' with no mention of real credentials being preserved, suggesting the original firebaseConfig object with real credentials may have been removed.",
