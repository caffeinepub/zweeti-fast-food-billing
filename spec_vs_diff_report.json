  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-36, REQ-37, REQ-38) appear to be implemented in the diff. The App.tsx file shows a useEffect hook checking localStorage for 'zweetiUser' on mount, a handleLogout function removing the key and calling location.reload(), a Logout button with no-print class, and login validation that alerts 'Enter valid 10 digit mobile number' for inputs not exactly 10 digits and stores valid input under 'zweetiUser'. No missing requirements or hallucinated features were identified.",
