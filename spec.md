# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add an auto-generated Invoice Number and a current Date field to the bill display in the Zweeti Billing app.

**Planned changes:**
- Generate an Invoice Number in the format `ZWT-YYYYMMDD-XXXX` (random 4-digit suffix) once when the page loads or a new bill is started.
- Display the current date formatted as `DD/MM/YYYY` on the bill card.
- Show both fields near the top of the bill card, above the customer name section, with bold labels `Invoice No:` and `Date:`.
- Make both fields read-only (non-editable).
- Ensure both fields are included in the printed bill (browser print) and in the PDF generated by the Download Bill button.

**User-visible outcome:** The bill card now shows a unique invoice number and the current date at the top, and both fields appear correctly in printed and downloaded PDF versions of the bill.
